# History

Originally crafted for DHOxSS 2017 and stored in a separate repo: https://github.com/elliewix/HumDataCarp.

This lesson is designed to run in a comfortable 2 hours with live coding and interaction.

The goal of this lesson is to provide a guided tour of:

* how Python can be valuable in exploring text
* what scripts are
* what it looks like to run and execute code
* how to think about approaching a reseach programming task in this space
* essential vocabulary around code and Python

Learners will have a better understanding of what kinds of questions Python can answer, and get a realistic experience of knowing what it means to code. This is not meant to be a tutorial to programming or CS, but should provide a great foundation for someone to make an informed choice about pusuing programming education and for any subsequent coursework.
